Four Aces Contracts

These are the MarkDown versions of the word documents that is used to generate the contracts.

Note that the numbering list system *does* reset.

That means that this:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   c) Things
   d) More things
```

Will be displayed as this in the final PDF version:

```
12) Blah blah
   a) Stuff
   b) Stuff
13) Things
14) Things
   a) Things
   b) More things
```

### How am I supposed to interpret its layout?

[Already explained.](https://github.com/CheAle14/FourAcesContracts/blob/master/Membership.md#xvii-layout-of-terms)

# How do I suggest changes?

1. You may want to [open an issue](https://github.com/CheAle14/FourAcesContracts/issues) that describes the change, why it is needed, and why the current version does not do enough. *You could skip straight to step 2 and open a pull request.*
2. Optionally (or alternativly) you may make the changes yourself and submit them under a pull review.
    1. You may do this from in-browser: Find the Pencil icon to the top-right of the file, make the changes, then commit the change to your cloned repository (github will create one for you) and open a pull request (again, github will do this for you)
    2. Also, you may fork this repository to your own profile, then clone it to your computer, then make whatever changes you please, then commmit, push and finally open a pull request. This may be desireable for large changes.
3. Once a pull request has been opened for the change, the M.O.G. Division Head shall transcribe the changes, exactly, into the proper formatted document and re-commit and formatting differences this may make. Then, such formatted document shall be submitted under proper review as indicated in the contract.
4. The submitted changes may thus be approved and become enforced, or may be rejected and your pull request closed.
