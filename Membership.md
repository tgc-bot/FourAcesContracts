Chip Ownership
--------------

14. All chips used are owned by Troy Smitten, and may not be lost,
    damaged, destroyed, exchanged, given or otherwise transferred except
    as allowed through the Casino's operations or through explicit
    consent of Mr Smitten.

15. All Chips are leased ownership to the Casino. The Casino has supreme
    authority on any chips where they are involved in the Casino's
    operations. An exception is given where there are reasonable
    requirements that Troy Smitten have the final say on the chip(s) in
    question.

16. Chips may not be possessed by any person that has not agreed to this
    Contract. Any person that attempts to do so must first agree to this
    Contract and its Terms, fully and completely to the extent necessary
    to protect the Casino and its operations.

17. In the scenario of play, a Member may allow another individual to
    posses or otherwise hold their chips. In this case, the Member must
    first disclose to Management exactly how many, and which type, of
    chips are to be held by this Member.

    z.  In the circumstance where Management is not informed, the Casino
        takes zero responsibilities and offers no assistance or
        insurance on those chips -- Management may consider such chips
        to be in the possession of whoever indeed possesses them, even
        if an agreement was made (but of course, was not disclosed to
        Management)

Poker
-----

18. Poker buy-ins are 25 chips.

19. A player may raise by any amount they wish, so long as they have the
    chips required to do so.

20. A player may only remove chips from the pot with any Staff member's
    approval, and only in situations that would require it, and where it
    would not be unfair to other players.

21. A player may fold at any time. When a player folds, they are no
    longer able to bet and must return their cards to the dealer. A
    player that has folded must remain folded until the end of the
    match. An exception can be made by consensus of Management, but only
    when the next player has not bet yet.

22. A player may go all in once betting starts. After an all-in, a
    showdown is immediately done

    a.  If only two players go all-in, then the lowest all-in bet is
        matched by the player with more chips, and any excess that
        player has is returned.

    b.  If more than two players, then the lowest all-in bet is matched
        by everyone, and this is placed with the main pot. That main pot
        can be won by anyone

        ii. Then, the next lowest all-in bet is matched by those
            remaining, but the chips are placed in a side pot. That side
            pot may only be won by players who have matched the bet into
            that side pot

        iii. This continues until the player with the highest amount
            remains, any extra they have is kept by them

        iv. The order of which pot is looked at first shall be from the
            side pot with the fewest number of people contested for it,
            to the main pot itself.

    c.  These bets ***must*** be kept in separate places, with the 'main
        pot' all in bet being placed closest to the dealer, and each
        subsequent being placed *clearly separate* away from the dealer.

23. A player may bet once all players have paid the buy-in, have all
    their cards, and the first 3 cards are placed down. A player may
    call a previous player's bet, and match it with their own chips, as
    long as there are less than five cards on the table. A player may
    raise another player's bet, matching it and then betting higher than
    the previous bet. A player may also check, but only where there is
    no previous bet -- this means that they do not raise.

24. A player is never unable to bet -- if they do not have the required
    amount to match a previous bet, they may decide to go all in and the
    above all in rules will be used.

25. When there are five cards on the table, players may continue betting
    and folding. If all players decide to call the current bet, then the
    game is finished, and the players must show their hands.

26. Any action to raise, fold, check, call, etc must be vocalised: the
    player must clearly announce their intentions -- the dealer may
    accept a 'knocking' on the table to signify a check but may request
    clarification if they deem an action to be ambiguous.

27. A player's first action is accepted and cannot be changed: if a
    player says that they check, then say that they raise, the action of
    checking is accepted only.

28. The Dealer may decide to call to a close betting when there are five
    cards. The game will finish, with players showing their cards.

29. The Staff of the Casino make the ultimate, unanimous, decision
    regarding which player had the strongest hand and has thus won.

30. Typical Poker rules apply.

    d.  *Typical Poker rules* are defined as rules where it can be
        demonstrated they are in use across multiple independent
        Casinos.

    e.  These rules cannot be found to invalidate this contract or its
        terms.

    f.  These rules may be invalidated by Management, with consensus.

### Poker Stars / Coundon Coins

Poker Stars (also known as Coundon Coins) have been revised such that:

-   Any member may hand in 1 Coundon Coin in exchange for 3000 chips.

-   No members can exchange chips for Coundon coins; Coundon coins are
    no longer given a return value, as they are no longer designed to be
    returned.

These revisions *may* be altered by Management, such that Poker Stars
may be returned in exchange for chips -- but only in circumstances where
it is fair and deemed necessary, by consensus of Management.

### Poker Rake

31. The Casino has the authority to enforce a rake within any poker game
    in the Casino.

32. Rakes are a scaled commission fee, taken to support the wages, staff
    and costs incurred by running this Casino.

33. The rake is set at a value of 10% of the pot. The rake is taken by
    Management into the Casino's vault at the end of all rounds of a
    poker game.

    g.  The percentage value of the rake may be changed/altered by this
        contract under certain conditions -- but must not exceed 15%
        under any circumstances.

    h.  The rake may be decreased to 5%, or 7.5% - to the Owner's
        discretion.

    i.  The rake is decreased to 0% for the Casino and may be similarly
        waivered for the Owner.

Blackjack
---------

34. The player may bet any reasonable amount, with a minimum of 50

35. If a player receives two cards of the same value, they may split
    their cards into two hands.

    a.  The player must then match their current bet for their
        additional hand

    b.  The player may win with either, or both, of their hands

    c.  The player does not immediately lose if one hand is bust

    d.  The player may stick with either, or both, of their hands

    e.  The player must be dealt two more cards for each hand -- the new
        card is placed face-up for the left hand, but face-down for the
        right hand.

    f.  The player must first start hitting on their left hand. Once
        they have stuck or gone bust on that hand, they must then move
        to their right hand, at which point they may then look at the
        face-down card.

    g.  The player may not start hitting again on their first hand once
        they have moved to their second.

36. The player may decide to double-down their hand if they have not yet
    hit.

<!-- -->

a.  The player must double their current bet, and take only one
    additional card

b.  The player cannot hit again and must either stick with what they
    have or go bust should they go over 21

<!-- -->

37. The player may decide to surrender their hand only when they have
    not yet hit.

    j.  The player takes back half of their bet, and the other half goes
        to the dealer

38. Once a player wins, the dealer will match their bet and the player
    will receive this amount.

39. If a player (or the dealer) immediately gets 21 with only two cards
    (this is called a *'natural'* or *'blackjack'*) (i.e., an ace and
    any 'ten-card'), the following conditions apply:

<!-- -->

a.  If any player gets a natural, and the dealer does not, the dealer
    immediately matches the players' bets and gives them this amount.

b.  If the dealer has a natural, he immediately takes the bets of all
    players that do not have a natural.

c.  The dealer may look at their face-down card if their face-up card
    would allow a natural (i.e. an ace or a ten-card)

<!-- -->

40. If the Dealer's face up card is an Ace, any player may place
    *Insurance.*

<!-- -->

a.  Insurance is kept separate from the player's main bet and is a
    maximum bet of half of their main bet.

b.  If the dealer's second (face-down) card is not a ten-card, then
    players lose the amount that they insured.

c.  If the dealer's second (face-down) card is any ten-card then the
    players that have paid insurance do not lose either of their bets.

<!-- -->

41. All players play against the Dealer, if they get a higher amount
    than the Dealer, their bet is matched. The game continues for each
    player until all players have either stuck or folded; at that point,
    the Dealer hits themselves until they either win, are forced to
    stick or bust.

    k.  For instances where the player(s) or Dealer gets a blackjack
        (Ace + Ten card), then see above.

42. The Staff make the ultimate decision of who, and how much, has been
    won.

73. The M.O.L. has the authority to tax the winnings of a game when it
    is a player with a loan that wins. This tax can be no more than 25%
    of the player's winnings.

74. To ensure the Casino is repaid the loans it gives, the Casino may:

    m.  Remove the chips placed into the pot by a person with a loan
        when that pot is won by anyone other than the person with that
        loan; but only when the chips removed do not exceed 100, and do
        not exceed 10% of the pot value, and do not exceed the minimum
        daily payment required against the loan.

    n.  Directly remove chips from a person with a loan at the end of
        the day's sitting to a value not exceeding the minimum daily
        payment of the loan. Discretion is given such that Management
        may decide if they are to remove chips.

75. A Member may wish to use another player as a guarantee: if the
    initial loaned member fails to repay the loan, then the guarantee
    member's chips are used to cover the loan.

    o.  The M.O.L. may seize this guarantee's member's chips to cover
        the minimal chip payment, or to seize payment in full.

    p.  The M.O.L. may not seize in total more than the initial chip
        value that was given by the Casino at the start of the loan

Other Additional Rules
======================

    r.  Each player receives two cards, and five cards are placed on the

    s.  The player with the highest/winning hand wins the lottery pot.

    t.  If multiple players have the same best 5 cards, then the lottery

77. The VIP Club is a Management-sponsored group of members that receive
    additional benefits and opportunities that non-club members would
    otherwise not be given.

78. Club members will have to pay a 200 chip membership fee directly

79. Club members are given an additional two games grace as described
    below

80. Club members rake is reduced depending on the number of weeks they

    u.  The first week a Member is a VIP, their rake is 7.5%

    v.  Each subsequent week their rake is decreased by 0.5%, to a

    immediately be revoked of the above privileges.

85. The 'High Roller' for each week is automatically permitted free

High Stakes Poker Games
-----------------------

1.  High stakes poker games are normal poker games as explained above
    with a few changes:

    a.  The starting bet is 50 chips; (if any,) bets on the flop must be
        no lower than 75

    b.  The minimum bet is one and a half of the previous round's bet.
        (ex: if the last round was raised by 100 (and matched by all)
        then the next round must start at 150 -- rounded up where ever
        needed)

Fees for not playing
--------------------

For each game that is missed, a player will be given 50 chips-worth in a
penalty. This penalty will be allowed a 'grace' period, of three games,
per week. If the player does not exceed a missed-game count of three per
week, then their count is reset on the next week. If the player does
exceed three games per week, they shall be fined a cumulative penalty.
As shown:

-   On the third game missed, the penalty is at 150 chips and is the
    final allowed missed game. (the penalty would not, at this point, be
    deducted)

-   On the fourth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 200 chips.

-   On the fifth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 250 chips.

-   On the sixth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 300 chips.

-   On the seventh game missed, the penalty is deducted at 350 chips.

-   On the eighth game missed, the penalty is deducted at 400 chips.

And so on.

Repeated, deliberate, missing of games may result in a further penalty
or termination of Membership -- even if the Member does not exceed the
three-time grace period.
